# Introduction to Neural Networks with Pokemon

We explore introductory concepts of neural networks using the following Pokemon data:
- Sprites (https://pokemondb.net/sprites)
- Type and basic stats (https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all)
- Type chart (https://pokemondb.net/type)

The concepts covered are based on the [Introduction to Deep Learning(https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/home/welcome) offered by National Research University Higher School of Economics.
