# Introduction to Neural Networks with Pokemon

We explore introductory concepts of neural networks using the following Pokemon data:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sprites (https://pokemondb.net/sprites)
  \item Type and basic stats (https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all)
  \item Type chart (https://pokemondb.net/type)
\end{itemize}

The concepts covered are based on the (Introduction to Deep Learning)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-to-deep-learning/home/welcome] offered by National Research University Higher School of Economics.
